        "\n",
        "This program determines if all levels of a game can be completed based on the levels cleared by two players. The logic works as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Input Handling:**\n",
        "   - The program takes an integer `n`, representing the total number of levels in the game.\n",
        "   - Two lists, `X` and `Y`, are provided:\n",
        "     - `X` contains the levels cleared by the first player, where the first element is the count of levels cleared, and the remaining elements are the actual levels.\n",
        "     - `Y` contains the levels cleared by the second player, structured similarly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Combine Levels Cleared:**\n",
        "   - A list `temp` is initialized with all levels cleared by the first player (`X[1:]`).\n",
        "   - The program iterates through the levels cleared by the second player (`Y[1:]`):\n",
        "     - If a level is not already in `temp`, it is appended.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Check All Levels:**\n",
        "   - If the length of `temp` is equal to `n`, it prints `\"I become the guy.\"`.\n",
        "   - Otherwise, it prints `\"Oh, my keyboard!\"`."
