In order to achieve this the height of each of the friends should not exceed h. If the height of some person is greater than h he can bend down and then he surely won't be noticed by the guard. The height of the i-th person is equal to ai.\n",

        "   - The program iterates through each element in the list `arr` using a `for` loop.\n",
        "   - For each element, it checks if the element is perfectly divisible by `h`:\n",
        "     - If `arr[i] % h == 0`, it adds `arr[i] // h` to `temp`.  \n",
        "     - Otherwise, it adds `arr[i] // h + 1` to `temp`. This accounts for the remainder by rounding up the division to the nearest integer.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Output the result:** After completing the loop, `temp` holds the cumulative value based on the above logic, which is then printed."
