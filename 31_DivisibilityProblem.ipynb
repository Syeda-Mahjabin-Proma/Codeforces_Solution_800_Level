        "This program calculates the smallest number to add to `a` to make it divisible by `b` for multiple test cases. The logic works as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Input Handling:**\n",
        "   - The program takes an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.\n",
        "   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Divisibility Check:**\n",
        "   - For each pair `(a, b)`:\n",
        "     - If `a % b == 0`, it means `a` is already divisible by `b`, so the result is `0`.\n",
        "     - Otherwise:\n",
        "       - The program calculates the next multiple of `b` after `a` by finding `(b * (a // b + 1))`.\n",
        "       - The difference between this next multiple and `a` is calculated as `count = (b * (result + 1)) - a`, where `result = a // b`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Output the Result:**\n",
        "   - For each test case, the program prints the value of `count`, which represents the smallest number to add to `a` to make it divisible by `b`."
