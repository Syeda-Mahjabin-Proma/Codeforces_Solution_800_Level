Count the minimum number of stones to take from the table so that any two neighboring stones had different colors. Stones in a row are considered neighboring if there are no other stones between them.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Iterating Through the Stones:**\n",
        "   - The program loops through the stones starting from the second one (`x = 1`).\n",
        "   - In each iteration, it checks if the current stone (`string_input[x]`) is the same as the previous stone (`string_input[x - 1]`).\n",
        "     - If the two stones are the same, it indicates that we need to remove one of them. Therefore, `count` is incremented by 1.\n",
        "     - If the stones are different, the program moves to the next stone without any change in `count`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Final Result:** After the loop ends, the variable `count` will hold the total number of consecutive stones that are the same. The minimum number of stones to remove is `count - 1` because each pair of consecutive stones that are the same requires one removal."
