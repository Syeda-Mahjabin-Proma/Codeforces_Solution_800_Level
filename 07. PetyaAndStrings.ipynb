Now Petya wants to compare those two strings lexicographically. The letters' case does not matter, that is an uppercase letter is considered equivalent to the corresponding lowercase letter. Help Petya perform the comparison.\n",

        "   - An `output` list is initialized to store differing characters from each word.\n",
        "\n",

        "3. **Character Comparison:** For each character in the two words, if the characters at the same position differ, they are added to the `output` list. `output[0]` collects differing characters from the first word, and `output[1]` collects those from the second.\n",
        "\n",

        "   - If `output[0]` or `output[1]` is empty (meaning the words are identical), it prints `0`.\n",
        "   - If they differ, the program compares the ASCII values of the first characters in the differing portions:\n",
        "     - If the first differing character in `output[0]` has a lower ASCII value than that in `output[1]`, it prints `-1`.\n",
