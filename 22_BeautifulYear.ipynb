        "   - A `while` loop runs to process the digits of the current year:\n",
        "     - If the digit at position `x` in `year` is not already in `check`, it is appended to `check`, and `x` is incremented to check the next digit.\n",

        "       - `year` is incremented by 1 (converted back to an integer, incremented, and converted to a string).  \n",
        "       - `check` is reset to an empty string, and `x` is reset to `0` to restart the check for the new year.\n",

        "   - Once a year with all unique digits is found, the loop exits, and the program prints the value of `check`, which now holds the unique digits of that year."
