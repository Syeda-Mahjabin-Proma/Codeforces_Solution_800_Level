        "*Time limit per test: 1 second & Memory limit per test: 256 megabytes. <br>\n",
        "Sometimes some words like \"localization\" or \"internationalization\" are so long that writing them many times in one text is quite tiresome.*\n",

        "\n",
        "This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last letter of a word and between them we write the number of letters between the first and the last letters. That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.\n",

        "Thus, \"localization\" will be spelt as \"l10n\", and \"internationalization\" will be spelt as \"i18n\".\n",
