        "1. **Input Handling:** The program takes an integer input, `n`, representing the number rooms in the room and each of the next n lines contains two integers, `p` (people living in the room) and `q` (represents the room can accommodate)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Initialization:** A counter variable `count` is initialized to 0 to track the number of rooms where George and Alex can move in.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Processing the Pairs:** The program iterates n times and reads the integers p and q from the input. After that it checks if **`p+2 <= q`** or not as both of George & Alax need to move on to a new room. The count increments if true.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Output the Result:** After processing all the values it prints the value of `count` indicating the total number of available room to move on."
