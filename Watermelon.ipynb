After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.\n",

The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.\n",

        "2. **Special Case (Weight of 2):** A weight of 2 is not acceptable because dividing it results in two parts of 1 kg, which does not meet the even-weight condition. Therefore, it prints `\"NO\"` for this case.\n",
        "3. **Divisibility Check:** For other weights, if the weight is an even number (divisible by 2), it can be split into two even parts, so the program prints `\"YES\"`. If the weight is odd, it cannot be evenly split, so it prints `\"NO\"`.\n"
