Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+3.\n",

        "1. **Input Parsing:**\n",
        "   - The input string `given_val` contains numbers separated by `+` symbols.\n",
        "   - The code splits this string by the `+` symbol, resulting in a list of string numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Convert to Integers and Sort:**\n",
        "   - Each split part is converted to an integer and added to the list `numbers`.\n",
        "   - The `numbers` list is then sorted in ascending order.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Create Output String:**\n",
        "   - An empty string `result` is used to build the final sorted output.\n",
        "   - The code iterates over the sorted list `numbers`, appending each number to `result` as a string, followed by a `+`.\n",
        "   - After the loop, `result[:-1]` is printed to remove the last `+` symbol, ensuring the output is correctly formatted."
