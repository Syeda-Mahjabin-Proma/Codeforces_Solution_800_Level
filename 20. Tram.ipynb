At the i-th stop ai passengers exit the tram, while bi passengers enter it. The tram is empty before it arrives at the first stop. Also, when the tram arrives at the last stop, all passengers exit so that it becomes empty.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Update passenger count for each station:**  \n",
        "   - The program iterates over the range of `station_num`. For each station:\n",
        "     - It takes two inputs, `exit` (number of passengers leaving the tram) and `entry` (number of passengers entering the tram). These are read using `map(int, input().split())`.\n",
        "     - It updates `total` by subtracting `exit` and adding `entry`.  \n",
        "     - The updated `total` is appended to the `seat` list.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Find and print the maximum number of passengers:**  \n",
        "   - The program calculates the maximum value in the `seat` list using `max(seat)` and prints it."
